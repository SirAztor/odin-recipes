        <h3>A basic recipe on Uruguayan cuisine</h3>
        <p>You can serve this with French fries, rice, refried beans, or a salad</p>
        <p>It is quick, easy and delicious!</p>

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>2 large eggs, or more as needed</li>
                <li>40 saltine crackers, smashed</li>
                <li>4 thin slices boneless round steak</li>
                <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
                <li>vegetable oil for frying</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Crack eggs in a medium bowl and beat slightly with a fork or whisk. Set aside. Place smashed crackers on a plate big enough for the steak.</li>
                <li>Season steak with salt and pepper and soak in the beaten egg. Transfer to the smashed crackers and cover both sides with the crackers using a spoon; you can press a little bit with the spoon so that the crackers stick better.</li>
                <li>Heat a frying pan over medium heat and add enough oil to cover the bottom half of the steaks. Cook 2 steaks in the hot oil until crackers have turned light golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Turn and continue to cook until golden and meat is no longer pink, 4 to 5 minutes more. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil. Repeat with remaining steaks.</li>
            </ol>
